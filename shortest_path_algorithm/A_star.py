    Standard A* pathfinding on a NetworkGraph.
    Supports two modes:
    - Standard (extended=False): finds the shortest path between two node ids in the original graph.
    - Extended (extended=True): operates on a time-expanded graph. The goal is matched by the 'original_id' node attribute, so the agent can reach the
      goal at any feasible timestep. The heuristic uses the spatial coordinates of the goal at t=0 as a reference.

    Duplicate entries in the heap are handled in the following way: when a node is popped, it is skipped if a better path was already found
    (checked via f_current > f[current]).

    Args:
        G: directed NetworkGraph (standard or time-expanded)

    """
    A* with focal search — low-level planner for BCBS.
    Maintains two lists:
    - OPEN: list of all discovered nodes, ordered by f = g + h.
      f_min (minimum f in OPEN) defines the suboptimality threshold.
    - FOCAL: subset of OPEN with f <= w * f_min, ordered by g_c
      (accumulated congestion cost). The node with lowest g_c in focal is expanded,
      minimising conflicts with other agents within the cost bound.

    Key difference from standard A*:
    Instead of always expanding the node with lowest f, focal search
    expands the node with lowest g_c among those within the cost bound.
    This trades a small cost increase (bounded by w) for fewer conflicts.
    When w=1, FOCAL = {nodes with f == f_min} and the behaviour matches
    standard A* when all g_c values are equal (no congestion).
    Duplicate handling: OPEN is a plain list. When a better path to a node
    is found, the old entry is removed before appending the new one.

    Args:
        G: directed NetworkGraph (standard or time-expanded)

        goal:goal node id (standard) or original_id (extended)
        congestion_dict: {expanded_node_id: count} — number of other agents
        passing through each node in the current CT solution. Used to compute g_c incrementally during expansion.
        extended: if True, uses time-expanded graph logic
        heuristic: spatial heuristic h(G, node, goal_ref) (default: h_manhattan)
        conflict_heuristic: heuristic for congestion use for ordering of FOCAL
        w: suboptimality factor.

        w>1  -> bounded suboptimal (cost <= w * C*), faster.
